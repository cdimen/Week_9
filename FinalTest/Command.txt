The command i used to add the project and file is "git add 'MyFile.txt'"

I used the exact same command to add both of the InfoFile files (git add "InfoFile1" or "InfoFile2")

To change the user name, I used "git config --global user.name 'cdimen_Info'" command

To add the Command.txt file into the project, I used the "git add" command

To know the current state of the project, just use the "git status" command

I learned that I always have to add the files if these files are edited, however they are not committed yet, so we can commit this files later
